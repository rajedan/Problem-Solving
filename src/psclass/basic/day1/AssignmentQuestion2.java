/**
 * Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find
 * two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
 * 
 * Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 Output: [1,2] Explanation: The sum
 * of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
 * 
 * Note: Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based. You
 * may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not
 * use the same element twice.
